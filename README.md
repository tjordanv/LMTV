# LMTV
This beautiful mini project was designed by me and 3 other engineers as the final capstone project in our Full Stack Engineering bootcamp. LMTV is a home planning helper tool that allows users to customize the features of a home and receive back a quote estimate of how much the home will cost to build. 

It is worth noting that LMTV is no longer maintained and there are third-party APIs that may cause bugs in the application.
